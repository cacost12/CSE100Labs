// DESCRIPTION
// This program does x, y, and z. Then it explodes with such force that it
// triggers massive world-wide geothermal volcanic activity that ultimately
// results in the almost complete extinction of all life on Earth with the
// exception of members of the order Blattodea, which have always been destined
// to someday rule the world anyway.
